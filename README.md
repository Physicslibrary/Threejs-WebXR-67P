# Threejs-WebXR-67P (under construction)

Visualize the size of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in Oculus Quest.

Rosetta 1km from 67P comet.

Rosetta 10km from 67P comet.

This project was inspired by a European Space Agency's webpage explaining the relative size of the Rosetta space probe to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko:
 
[ESA: How big is Rosetta compared with the comet?](http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/54831-how-big-is-rosetta-compared-with-the-comet/)
 
With ESA and NASA open sourcing their data such as 3D models and images, Three.js, a modern web browser with WebXR, and Blender can be used to visualize models of a comet (4100m) and Rosetta (31m) in virtual reality.

# Hardware

Oculus Quest recommended (required 6DOF headset/controllers).<br>

# Software

Oculus Browser (Oculus Quest Firmware update 12.0 or latest, supporting WebXR).

# Installation

No installation. In Oculus Quest, open Oculus Browser and go to link (still testing):

[https://physicslibrary.github.io/Threejs-WebXR-67P/test/webxr_vr_ballshooter-2.html](https://physicslibrary.github.io/Threejs-WebXR-67P/test/webxr_vr_ballshooter-2.html)

The examples use Oculus Touch controllers to "fly" around Rosetta and comet 67P. It implements a simple way to move around 3D by making a "velocity vector" from left to right controllers.<br>

The distance between controllers is the speed (next to each other is the lowest speed).<br>

Press one front trigger to move (two triggers to double speed).<br>

Hold the left controller fixed and point the right controller in the direction to move.<br>

The simple "fly" code is based on webvr_vr_ballshooter.html before the recent three.js update to WebXR in December 2019.<br>

Note - The white lines from the controllers are not meant for pointing direction to move but with seeing where the controllers are (codes from webvr_vr_ballshooter.html). The line is approx 1m in length so it good for something like getting rough measurement of Rosetta.<br>

Other buttons on controllers do not work, yet.<br>

Blender 2.81 (or latest) is used to scale CSHP\_DV\_257\_01\_\_\_\_\_\_\_00343.obj to 4100m and is exported as "glTF Binary" 67P.glb. 

Rosetta.blend (2012 version) is opened with Blender 2.81, fixed few broken things, and exported as "glTF Binary" rosetta.glb.

km_markers.glb is created in Blender as a series of 10mx10mx10m cubes spaced by 1km to give a sense of distance.
